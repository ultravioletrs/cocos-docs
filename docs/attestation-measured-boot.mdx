# Measured boot

This chapter will go over a feature called "measured boot" and how it fits in the whole process of attestation. 
It will separately describe AMD SEV-SNP measured boot which relies on TPMs and Intel TDX measured which relies on RTMR registers.
In addition, it will describe Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) and how it is used to measure the integrity of the system after the kernel is loaded.

### Static Root of Trust for Measurement (SRTM)

In the context of attestation, a Static Root of Trust for Measurement (SRTM) is a foundational security mechanism used to establish the integrity of a system from the moment it powers on.
It represents the initial chain of trust in a measured boot process, where each component in the boot sequence—starting from the firmware—measures the next component before transferring control.
These measurements are securely stored in specific registers (TPM PCRs in case of AMD, RTMRs in case of Intel), forming a verifiable log of the boot process.
The purpose of SRTM is to provide a remote verifier with cryptographic evidence that the system has booted in a known-good and untampered state, enabling informed trust decisions about the system’s integrity.

For AMD SEV-SNP, the SRTM is established by the platform firmware (e.g., BIOS or UEFI) which begins by measuring itself and other early boot components into the TPM.
While SEV-SNP protects the confidentiality and integrity of the VM memory during runtime, it also relies on SRTM measurements to assure that the host platform and hypervisor were in a secure and trusted state before the VM launch.
These measurements contribute to the attestation report generated by the AMD Secure Processor, enabling remote verifiers to assess both the pre-launch state and the SEV-SNP-protected guest environment.

In Intel TDX, a similar SRTM process is involved.
The platform firmware initiates SRTM by measuring itself and subsequent components.
However, Intel TDX introduces an additional trust boundary at the point where a TDX module inside the CPU initializes the Trusted Domain (TD).
This TD initialization includes its own measurements, stored in RTMRs (Runtime Measurement Registers), which are specific to the TDX attestation model.
These RTMRs (for dynamic measurements during TD launch) allow verifiers to assess the complete trust chain from power-on through TD execution, ensuring both a trusted platform and an isolated, attested guest environment.

## Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

A TPM is a dedicated security chip designed to perform tamper-resistant cryptographic functions.
It securely manages sensitive artifacts such as encryption keys, certificates, and integrity measurements.
In scenarios where TPM functionality is implemented via software instead of hardware, it is referred to as a virtual TPM (vTPM).

The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) plays a fundamental role in the process of attestation by providing a tamper-resistant foundation for cryptographic operations, securing sensitive artifacts, measuring system state, and enabling attestation mechanisms.

Remote attestation verifies the integrity of a client platform by retrieving a quote from the TPM, which includes signed Platform Configuration Register (PCR) values.
This process involves Event Log Verification, which ensures that recorded system events align with the expected platform state.

To enable vTPM follow instructions in the table below.

### Platform Configuration Register (PCR)

A Platform Configuration Register (PCR) is a secure memory region within the TPM that records system integrity measurements.
Instead of being overwritten, PCR values are extended through a cryptographic hash function:

$$
PCR[N] = \text{HASH}_{\text{alg}}( PCR[N] \, || \, \text{NewMeasurement} )
$$

This ensures that all recorded values remain linked and verifiable, making PCRs essential for attestation and system security.  

### Trusted Boot and Integrity Measurement

System integrity is ensured by measuring and recording each boot component into the Trusted Platform Module (TPM).
The firmware acts as the **Static Root of Trust for Measurement (SRTM)**, measuring critical components and storing their hashes in the TPM's Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs).
These values are extended immutably, creating a tamper-proof record.

This process enables secure attestation, ensuring that only verified software executes and detecting unauthorized modifications.
The TPM also functions as a **Root of Trust for Storage (RTS)** and **Root of Trust for Reporting (RTR)**, allowing for remote verification of system integrity.

### What is Verified in Each PCR

A typical TPM has 24 PCRs.
The specific content verified in each PCR depends on the platform and implementation, however most implementations follow a common structure:

#### Static PCRs (0-7) - SRTM Measurements

- **PCR 0:** Core Root of Trust for Measurement (CRTM) and UEFI firmware
- **PCR 1:** Platform and motherboard configuration
- **PCR 2:** UEFI driver and ROM code
- **PCR 3:** UEFI driver and ROM code configuration
- **PCR 4:** UEFI Boot Manager code
- **PCR 5:** UEFI Boot Manager configuration and GPT table
- **PCR 6:** Host platform manufacturer control
- **PCR 7:** Secure Boot state and certificates

#### Dynamic PCRs (8-15) - OS and Application Measurements

- **PCR 8:** Boot loader (GRUB, systemd-boot)
- **PCR 9:** Kernel and initramfs
- **PCR 10:** Linux IMA measurements
- **PCR 11:** BitLocker access control
- **PCR 12:** Boot events and configuration
- **PCR 13:** Module signature verification
- **PCR 14:** MokList (Machine Owner Keys)
- **PCR 15:** System firmware updates

#### Debug and Locality PCRs (16-23)

- **PCR 16:** Debug and development use
- **PCR 17-22:** Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM)
- **PCR 23:** Application-specific measurements

The table below shows the PCRs used in CocosAI and what is verified in each of them for a different platform.

By leveraging PCR measurements, systems maintain **trusted execution environments**, ensuring the integrity of Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) and other secure workloads.

### Event Log Verification

In addition to the PCR values, the vTPM quote also includes a log of all significant events that happened during the boot process.
This ensures the platform’s integrity by checking if the recorded events match the expected state.

1. The CLI requests a quote from the client.
2. The Agent asks the TPM to sign the current PCR values using the AK private key and sends the signed quote to the CLI.
3. The CLI verifies the quote’s signature using the AK public key, ensuring the PCR values are legitimate.
4. The CLI replays the event log to reconstruct the PCR values. If the recalculated values match the received PCRs, the event log is verified.
5. The verified PCR values are then compared against predefined golden(good) values for the TPM. If they match the expected values in the vTPM quote, the platform's integrity is confirmed.

A secure communication channel is required between the attester and the relying party, which is established using attested TLS.

## RTMR registers

Intel TDX has four Run-Time Measurement Registers (RTMR 0-3) inside every Trust Domain; they are SHA-384 registers that form the TD’s equivalent of TPM PCRs.
Each register starts at zero and can be extended only from within the guest, so the hypervisor can never spoof or reset them.
This makes the RTMR set an ideal anchor for a measured-boot chain: you bind every software layer that executes after TD creation—virtual firmware data, boot loader, kernel, initrd, and policy blobs—to a specific register and later expose the resulting hashes in the TD Quote that the verifier will consume.

The TDX firmware design guide uses a simple mapping that works well in practice:

| RTMR | Typical contents                                     |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Firmware (TDVF) & first-stage bootloader/shim        |
| 1    | OS loader + kernel image                             |
| 2    | initrd, kernel-cmdline, device-tree or ACPI overlays |
| 3    | Late-boot applications or policy blobs               |


Keeping each class of artifact in its own register lets verifiers accept kernel updates without re-signing the firmware hash while still failing the quote if an attacker swaps the kernel command line.
To record a measurement you compute a SHA-384 digest of the component, then call TDCALL [TDG.MR.RTMR.EXTEND].
The call takes the RTMR index in RDX and the guest-physical address of a 48-byte buffer holding the digest in RCX; the TDX Module then automatically performs 

$$
RTMR[i] = \text{SHA}_{\text{384}}( RTMR[i] \, ‖ \, \text{digest} )
$$

Because the ABI insists on 64-byte alignment and rejects invalid indices, an unprivileged TD process cannot corrupt the chain, and the host cannot interfere because only TDX non-root mode may issue the leaf.
Most deployments pair that hashing step with ordinary UEFI Secure Boot.
TD-specific firmware (TDVF) verifies the signatures of shim/GRUB and the kernel and immediately after a signature succeeds it extends the digest of the verified binary into the appropriate RTMR.
Intel’s virtual-firmware design guide recommends storing immutable boot firmware in the MRTD build-time measurement and reserving RTMR 0 for configuration firmware volumes, RTMR 1 for the kernel and loader, RTMR 2 for the initrd and kernel command line, and RTMR 3 for late-boot policies—allowing you to roll kernel updates without re-signing the firmware baseline.
During attestation the guest first converts its local TD report into a TD Quote and that quote carries the full array of RTMRs.
The relying party walks the Intel PCS certificate chain, checks the quote’s ECDSA signature and freshness nonce, and then compares each RTMR against pre-approved hashes (or hash whitelists).
If any register differs, or if policy bits such as ATTRIBUTES.DEBUG are improperly set, the verifier rejects the session—providing the same integrity assurance that TPM-PCR measured boot delivers, but entirely inside the TDX security boundary.
## Linux IMA (Integrity Measurement Architecture)

Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) is a Linux kernel feature that provides a mechanism to record and verify the integrity of files and other system objects at load or access time.
At a high level, IMA computes cryptographic hashes of files (or other data) when they are used, maintains a log of these measurements, and can optionally enforce appraisal policies (e.g., signature checks) before allowing execution or access.
This helps detect unauthorized modifications and supports building trust in the system state.

### Overview

Primary objectives of Linux IMA are:

 - **Detection of Unauthorized Modifications**: By computing hashes of files and comparing them to known-good values or verifying signatures, IMA can detect tampering.
 - **Support for Remote Attestation**: Measurements can be extended into TPM PCRs (typically PCR 10 on AMD SEV-SNP setups) to allow a remote party to verify the boot-time and runtime integrity state of the system.
 - **Policy-Driven Measurement and Appraisal**: Flexible policy allows administrators to specify which files or operations to measure or appraise, balancing performance and security needs.
 - **Integration with Extended Attributes (EVM)**: Ensures integrity metadata (e.g., security labels, signatures stored as xattrs) cannot themselves be tampered with without detection.

Key aspects of IMA in general terms:

- **Measurement**: When a file (such as an executable, shared library, or configuration file) is opened, mapped, or otherwise used in a way covered by policy, the kernel computes a hash of its contents (and possibly metadata) and appends that measurement to an in-memory log. This log can be exposed to user space for auditing or further processing.

- **Policy-Driven**: Which files or operations are measured (or appraised) is determined by a policy. Administrators define simple rules (e.g., “measure all ELF binaries” or “appraise scripts under /usr/local/bin”) so that only relevant objects incur overhead.

- **Appraisal (Optional Enforcement)**: Beyond just measuring, IMA can verify that a file carries a valid digital signature (with the public key provisioned in the kernel) before permitting its use. If appraisal fails, the kernel can refuse to open or execute the file, or log a warning depending on configuration.

- **Logging and Auditing**: The sequence of measurements is kept in a log that can be read or exported. This enables administrators or automated systems to review which files were loaded and whether any unexpected changes occurred.

- **Integration with TPM/Attestation (Contextual Use)**: While IMA itself computes and logs hashes, in many deployments those measurements are extended into a TPM’s Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs). A remote verifier can then obtain a TPM quote including these PCR values, providing evidence that the system booted and ran only approved components. (Note: this integration is set up separately, but IMA provides the runtime measurements that feed into it.)

- **Performance Considerations**: Measuring every access can introduce overhead, so policies usually target only critical binaries or first-time loads. Subsequent accesses of immutable files may skip rehashing. Appraisal (signature checks) also adds cost, so it’s applied selectively.

- **Extended Metadata Protection**: IMA often works alongside EVM (Extended Verification Module), which protects integrity-related extended attributes (e.g., signatures stored in xattrs) so that metadata tampering is also detectable.

In essence, IMA provides a flexible, policy-driven way to observe and enforce file integrity at runtime in Linux.
It does not by itself decide trustworthiness—that comes from how measurements are evaluated (e.g., comparing hashes to a whitelist or verifying signatures)—but it ensures that each file’s state when accessed is recorded and, if configured, checked before use.
This mechanism underpins many integrity and attestation solutions by supplying reliable, tamper-evident records of what code and data have actually been loaded on the system.

### Integration with CocosAI

Eventhough IMA offers an appraise feature, CocosAI doesn't use it.
The reason for this decision is the fact that many public cloud provider offer images that don't have file measurements.
In these cases the VM doesn't boot since some of the critital binaries (system services etc.) are not executed because of the missing measurements.
Rather than relying on kernel-enforced appraisal, CocosAI adopts a local verification approach:

- An in-VM agent can fetch the current IMA measurement log.
- A CLI tool can request that data and combine it with TPM PCR10 values (or quotes).
- Verification is performed in user space (either locally or by forwarding to a remote attestation service). This design avoids boot failures on images without built-in measurements, while still leveraging IMA’s tamper-evident logs for post-boot integrity checking.

Linux IMA is enabled through grub command line arguments.
The command line needs to include `ima_policy=tcb` for IMA to be enabled.
On VM startup, CocosAI applies a configuration file (in `YAML` format) that changes the grub command line.
The change is made by editing `/etc/grub/default/ file.
Afterwards grub is update and the VM is rebooted in order to activate IMA kernel feature.

To ensure every file on the filesystem is measured (so that the log contains entries for all root-owned binaries and other critical files), CocosAI uses a command that accesses each file without reading its contents:

```bash
sudo find / -fstype ext4 -type f -uid 0 -exec dd if='{}' of=/dev/null count=0 status=none \;
```
What this does:

- `find /`: Traverse from the root directory.
- `-fstype ext4`: Restrict to filesystems of type ext4 (adjust if other filesystem types are used).
- `-type f -uid 0`: Match regular files owned by root.
- `-exec dd if='{}' of=/dev/null count=0 status=none \;`: For each path, open it via dd but copy zero blocks (`count=0`), which causes the kernel to open the file (triggering IMA measurement) without reading data, minimizing I/O overhead.
Each matched file is opened exactly once, causing IMA to compute and record its hash in the runtime measurement list.
After the reboot all files in the system are measured and their measurements are stored in the `/sys/kernel/security/integrity/ima/ascii_runtime_measurements` file.

When the VM boots and the Agent starts, the measurements can be fetche with CLI tool.
Every IMA mesurement extends PCR 10 register value.
This means that the value of that register can be used to verify that the content of the file with measurements is not tampered with.
When fetched, the measurements can be verified locally.
