# Attestation Report

## AMD SEV-SNP attestation

AMD SEV-SNP (Secure Encrypted Virtualization - Secure Nested Paging) provides hardware-based memory encryption and integrity protection for virtual machines (VMs), allowing them to run securely even on untrusted hypervisors.
A core feature of SEV-SNP is its attestation capability, which enables a VM to cryptographically prove its integrity and configuration to a remote verifier.

### Attestation Workflow
The SEV-SNP attestation process involves several key components:

- **Guest VM (Attester)**: Runs inside a secure VM with SEV-SNP enabled.
- **VMM/Hypervisor**: Facilitates access to attestation interfaces but is considered untrusted.
- **AMD Secure Processor (ASP)**: A trusted firmware component that handles attestation logic and signs attestation reports.
- **Remote Verifier**: External party that verifies the integrity and identity of the attested VM.
- **AMD Attestation Signing Service (ASK/ARK)**: AMD-operated certificate infrastructure that signs attestation keys and allows verifiers to validate signatures.

The typical workflow includes:

- The guest VM requests an attestation report by issuing an `SNP_GUEST_REQUEST_REPORT` instruction.
- The request includes a user-supplied nonce to guarantee freshness and may include additional runtime data (e.g., measurements).
- The Secure Processor returns a binary attestation report, signed with AMD’s device-specific key.
- The VM sends the report to the remote verifier.
- The verifier uses AMD’s ARK (AMD Root Key) and ASK (AMD Signing Key) certificate chain to validate the report signature and verify platform integrity and configuration.

### Attestation Report Structure
The SEV-SNP attestation report is a binary structure (typically ~4 KB) that contains the following fields:

| Offset [Byte] | Bits       | Name               | Description                                                                                   |

### Security Guarantees
The report allows a verifier to validate:

- **Platform authenticity**, via the AMD certificate chain.
- **Guest integrity**, via the measurement field (comparable to a PCR hash).
- **Freshness**, via the report_data which should contain a hash of the verifier’s nonce.
- **Configuration policy**, ensuring the guest runs with secure settings (e.g., no debug access).
- **Key binding**, where the attestation report binds the measurement to a public key used later for secure communication (e.g., TLS or key wrapping).


## Intel TDX attestation
Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) create a Trust Domain (TD) whose memory is transparently encrypted and whose CPU state is isolated from everything running in VMX-root (the host VMM, BIOS, SMM, system firmware, etc.).
Like AMD SEV-SNP, TDX’s most important cloud-security feature is remote attestation—a way for software inside the TD to prove to a distant verifier that it is:

  - running on genuine Intel® hardware with TDX enabled,
  - loaded from an expected initial image, and
  - executing with a runtime configuration that meets the verifier’s policy.
  
### Attestation Workflow
The TDX attestation process involves the following steps:

| Step | Who                              | What happens (high level)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Guest TD (attester)**          | Executes the TDCALL leaf **`TDG.MR.REPORT`** with a 64-byte `REPORTDATA` nonce supplied by the relying party.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2    | **TDX module (in SEAM mode)**    | Builds a 1024-byte **`TDREPORT_STRUCT`** that binds the TD’s measurements (MRTD + RTMRs) and configuration to the nonce, then authenticates the blob with a device-unique AES-GMAC.                                                                                            |
| 3    | **Quoting enclave / Service TD** | Converts the TD report into a **TD Quote** signed by an Intel Provisioning Certification Key (PCK).  The SGX quoting architecture is reused: `ENCLU[EVERIFYREPORT2]` checks the report MAC locally, then the quoting enclave signs it and attaches the PCK certificate chain.  |
| 4    | **Remote verifier**              | Validates the certificate chain up to the Intel TDX Root CA, checks the signature on the Quote, confirms that MRTD/RTMRs & TD attributes satisfy policy, and matches `REPORTDATA` to its nonce.                                                                                |

Key actors:

  - Guest TD (attester)
  - Host VMM (untrusted)
  - TDX module (firmware running in the new SEAM privilege mode)
  - Quoting enclave / Service TD
  - Intel Provisioning Certification Service (PCS)
  - Remote verifier

### Attestation Report Structure

### Security Guarantees
The report allows a verifier to validate:

  - **Platform authenticity** – Quote is signed by a PCK whose chain terminates at Intel’s TDX Root CA.                                                                                                                   
  - **TD integrity** – Initial image exactly matches the verifier’s reference hash.                                                                                                                                       
  - **Freshness** – Verifier’s nonce is baked into `ReportData` → MAC → Quote.                                                                                                                                            
  - **Runtime state & policy** – Attributes, XFAM, and each `RTMR[i]` allow the verifier to enforce debug-off, migratable-off, secure-boot, etc.                                                                          
  - **TD ↔ Key binding** – A TD can generate an internal keypair, put the public key into `ReportData`, and let the verifier bind that key to the measurements, enabling mutually-attested TLS (maTLS) or sealed storage.
