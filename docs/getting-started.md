# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding install the following requirements.

- [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) (version 1.21.6)

## Getting COCOS

Get the cocos repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultravioletrs/cocos.git
```

### HAL

Get the hardware abstraction layer from the [releases](https://github.com/ultravioletrs/cocos/releases) on the cocos repository. Two files will be required:

- `rootfs.cpio.gz` - Initramfs
- `bzImage` - Kernel

Create two directories in `cocos/cmd/manager`, which are `img` and `tmp`.

```bash
mkdir -p cocos/cmd/manager/img cocos/cmd/manager/tmp
```

Copy the downloaded files to `cocos/cmd/manager/img`.

```bash
wget https://github.com/ultravioletrs/cocos/releases/download/v0.2.0/bzImage -P cocos/cmd/manager/img
wget https://github.com/ultravioletrs/cocos/releases/download/v0.2.0/rootfs.cpio.gz -P cocos/cmd/manager/img
```

If using the latest version of cocos see the [Developer guide](developer-guide.md#building-hal) for instructions on building HAL.

### Generating Keys

Generate a public and private key pair for user communication with agent on cli.

Build cli

```bash
cd cocos
```

```bash
make cli
```

Generate keys

```bash
./build/cocos-cli keys
```

The output will be similar to this:

```bash
2024/08/11 23:44:40 Successfully generated public/private key pair of type: *rsa.PrivateKey
```

The keys will be saved as `public.pem` and `private.pem` in the current directory.

### Starting Cvms Server

The agent has a cvms gRPC client and needs a gRPC server to connect to. We have an example server for testing purposes in `test/cvms`. Run the server as follows:

#### Finding Your IP Address

When running the CVMS server, you'll need to use an IP address that is accessible from the VM rather than using localhost. To find your machine's IP address:

```bash
ip -a
```

Look for your network interface (such as wlan0 for WiFi or eth0 for Ethernet) and note the IP address. For example:

```bash
2: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 12:34:56:78:9a:bc brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.100/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlan0
```

In this example, the IP address is 192.168.1.100. You'll use this IP address when running the CVMS server and configuring the cvm using manager.

#### Run the Server

Run the server as follows:

```bash
HOST=<externally_accessible_ip> go run ./test/cvms/main.go <algo-path> <public-key-path> <attested-tls-bool> <data-paths>
```

`data-paths` can be empty, a single file or multiple files depending on the nature of the algorithm and type of data.

For example

```bash
HOST="192.168.1.100" go run ./test/cvms/main.go ./test/manual/algo/addition.py ./public.pem false
```

Since this is an addition example, the data paths are empty.

The output will be similar to this:

```bash
{"time":"2024-08-12T00:05:13.321374245+03:00","level":"INFO","msg":"manager_test_server service gRPC server listening at 192.168.1.100:7001 without TLS"}
```

The test server uses the paths to the algorithm and datasets to obtain the file and include the file hashes in the computation manifest. The files are uploaded to the agent via cli. The public key provided can be generated using OpenSSL or cocos-cli.

### Running Manager

Next, we need to start manager. But first, we'll need to install some prerequisites.

#### OVMF

Find the ovmf code file:

```bash
sudo find / -name OVMF_CODE.fd
```

The output will be similar to this:

```bash
/usr/share/edk2/ia32/OVMF_CODE.fd
/usr/share/edk2/x64/OVMF_CODE.fd
/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd
```

Find the ovmf vars file:

```bash
sudo find / -name OVMF_VARS.fd
```

the output will be similar to this

```bash
/usr/share/edk2/ia32/OVMF_VARS.fd
/usr/share/edk2/x64/OVMF_VARS.fd
/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS.fd
```

#### Start Manager

To start run:

```bash
cd cmd/manager
```

```bash
sudo \
MANAGER_QEMU_SMP_MAXCPUS=4 \
MANAGER_GRPC_HOST=localhost \
MANAGER_GRPC_PORT=7002
MANAGER_LOG_LEVEL=debug \
MANAGER_QEMU_ENABLE_SEV_SNP=false \
MANAGER_QEMU_OVMF_CODE_FILE=/usr/share/edk2/x64/OVMF_CODE.fd \
MANAGER_QEMU_OVMF_VARS_FILE=/usr/share/edk2/x64/OVMF_VARS.fd \
go run main.go
```

The output of the manager will be similar to this:

```bash
{"time":"2024-08-12T00:05:21.119156392+03:00","level":"INFO","msg":"-enable-kvm -machine q35 -cpu EPYC -smp 4,maxcpus=4 -m 2048M,slots=5,maxmem=30G -drive if=pflash,format=raw,unit=0,file=/usr/share/edk2/x64/OVMF_CODE.fd,readonly=on -drive if=pflash,format=raw,unit=1,file=/usr/share/edk2/x64/OVMF_VARS.fd -netdev user,id=vmnic,hostfwd=tcp::7020-:7002 -device virtio-net-pci,disable-legacy=on,iommu_platform=true,netdev=vmnic,addr=0x2,romfile=  -kernel img/bzImage -append \"earlyprintk=serial console=ttyS0\" -initrd img/rootfs.cpio.gz -nographic -monitor pty"}

2024/08/12 00:05:41 traces export: Post "http://localhost:4318/v1/traces": dial tcp [::1]:4318: connect: connection refused
```

##### Create a cvm

To create a cvm we'll need the host address used to start the cvms server. An example is shown below:

```bash
export MANAGER_GRPC_URL=localhost:7002
./build/cocos-cli create-vm --log-level debug --server-url "192.168.1.100:7001"
```

When the cvm boots, it will connect to the cvms server and receive a computation manifest. Once started agent will send back events and logs.

The output on the cvms test server will be similar to this:

```bash
{"time":"2024-08-12T00:05:13.321374245+03:00","level":"INFO","msg":"manager_test_server service gRPC server listening at :7001 without TLS"}
{"time":"2024-08-12T00:05:21.132925448+03:00","level":"DEBUG","msg":"received who am on ip address [::1]:39498"}

received agent log
&{message:"agent service gRPC server listening at :7002 without TLS" computation_id:"1" level:"INFO" timestamp:{seconds:1723410338 nanos:718373804}}
```

### Uploading artefacts

From the logs we see agent has been bound to port `6006` which we can use with agent cli to send the algorithm, datasets and retrieve results. In this case, the `AGENT_GRPC_URL` will be `localhost:6006`.

We export the agent grpc url

```bash
export AGENT_GRPC_URL=localhost:6006
```

Upload the algorithm

```bash
./build/cocos-cli algo ./test/manual/algo/addition.py ./private.pem -a python
```

The output will be similar to this:

```bash
2024/08/12 00:06:34 Uploading algorithm binary: ./test/manual/algo/addition.py
Uploading algorithm...  100% [=========================================================================================================================>]
2024/08/12 00:06:34 Successfully uploaded algorithm
```

### Reading the results

Since this algorithm doesn't have a dataset we can go straight to reading the results

```bash
./build/cocos-cli result ./private.pem
```

The output will be similar to this:

```bash
2024/08/12 00:06:54 Retrieving computation result file
2024/08/12 00:06:54 Computation result retrieved and saved successfully!
```

To read the results

```bash
unzip result.zip -d results
```

```bash
cat results/result.txt
```

```bash
python3 test/manual/algo/addition.py test results/result.txt
```

Both should return the same result.

```bash
15
```

The output from the manager will be similar to this:

```bash

These logs provide detailed information about the operations of the manager and agent and can be useful for troubleshooting any issues that may arise.

For more information on running different algorithms and datasets see the [algorithms](./algorithms.md) documentation.

### Deleting the cvm

Once done the cvm can be destroyed by running:

```bash
./build/cocos-cli remove-vm <cvm_id>
```
