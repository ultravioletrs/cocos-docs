# Compliance & Audit Considerations

## Executive Summary

Cocos is a secure, open-source platform designed for compliance-sensitive environments.

It combines **hardware-based isolation**, **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) attestation**, and **hardened runtime security** to protect sensitive workloads and meet the highest audit and regulatory standards.

Through **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**, **Attested TLS**, and **transparent architecture**, Cocos ensures that data and algorithm remain confidential, verifiable, and auditable â€” making it a trusted foundation for regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and government.

## Overview

Cocos is designed with strong security guarantees to meet the needs of compliance-driven environments, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and auditability for sensitive workloads. By combining hardware-backed TEEs, TEE attestation, and hardened runtime configurations, Cocos provides a foundation for meeting strict regulatory requirements.

## Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)

Cocos supports hardware TEEs such as AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX, and Confidential VMs. These technologies:

- Isolate workloads from the host OS and hypervisor
- Protect data in use from unauthorized access
- Reduce the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) by running only essential components inside the CVM

This isolation ensures that even privileged system software cannot access protected data or code.

## Remote Attestation

Cocos implements remote attestation to verify the integrity of workloads at runtime. This includes:

- Measuring the initial code and data of the CVM before the CVM is started
- Measuring the boot process. This means that the kernel, initramfs, and kernel command line are measured
- Providing verifiable attestation reports to external verifiers
- Using **Attested TLS**, embedding attestation evidence directly into the X.509 certificate

These capabilities enable customers and auditors to verify that workloads run only in trusted, untampered environments.

## Integrity & Isolation

To maintain operational integrity and reduce attack surfaces, Cocos incorporates:

- **Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA)** to hash and keep track of opened files, before the files are executed
- Runtime image that disables unnecessary services (e.g., SSH)

This ensures that system components remain unchanged and trustworthy throughout their lifecycle.

## Secure Communications

All Cocos components communicate over encrypted channels with strong authentication:

- TLS with certificate-based authentication
- Attestation report bound to X.509 certificate
- Protection against man-in-the-middle and replay attacks

This ensures data-in-transit encryption and binds the attestation report to the TLS secure channel.

## Auditability & Transparency

Cocos is open source under the Apache 2.0 license, enabling:

- Independent code review and verification
- Transparent security architecture

This transparency builds trust and supports regulatory compliance audits.

## Continuous Security Improvements

Security features are continuously enhanced with each release. Examples include:

- SSH hardening
- Virtual TPM (vTPM) integration
- Expanded secure cloud integrations

## Summary

Cocos provides a secure and auditable platform ready for deployment in compliance-sensitive environments. Through hardware-backed isolation, TEE attestation, encrypted communications, and an open-source security model, Cocos enables organizations to meet modern data protection and audit requirements with confidence.
