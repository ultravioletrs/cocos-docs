# What is Cocos AI

Cocos AI (Confidential Computing System for AI) is a software platform designed to enable confidential and privacy-preserving AI and machine learning. It allows model training and inference to be performed directly on sensitive data—without ever exposing that data. This approach addresses one of the key challenges in AI today: protecting privacy while unlocking the full potential of intelligent systems. By ensuring trust and privacy, Cocos AI opens the door to secure and collaborative AI development.

At its core, Cocos AI is built on Confidential Computing—an emerging paradigm that uses specialized hardware (CPU extensions) to create secure, encrypted enclaves in memory, known as Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These enclaves isolate data and code from the rest of the system, providing a strong layer of protection even from privileged software on the host machine.

The result is a platform that empowers data scientists to train AI/ML models on private data—without ever seeing or exposing that data. It also supports Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), enabling joint analysis and model training across datasets from different sources. This capability unlocks significant value while maintaining strict privacy guarantees.
